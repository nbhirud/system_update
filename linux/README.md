# Things to note: 

### 1. I am not any linux expert. But I have been using linux lightly to host things at work and/or my home PC OS. So I may be wrong in places. I would appreciate if any linux expert corrects me. 
### 2. This is an attempt by me to firstly define good/important/necessary things to do to install/maintain/remove an OS.
### 3. Once the defining is satisfactorily done, my goal is to try to automate all of the defined steps if that is possible. I do not know if this is possible and how, but I am a believer in FOSS community and I am sure that I will find a way when I search If not, let's try to create a good enough script or something to do so.
