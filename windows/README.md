# Things to note: 

### 1. I have almost always been that guy (except first few years after getting my first PC when I didn't know about linux) who loves and believes in the philosophy and ease of use (when setup correctly by someone) of Linux. But I almost always had to have Windows as the primary OS on my primary computer because of compatibility and availability issues of some applications/services that I need to have access to. 
### 2. Right now I happen to have more than 1 computer in my possession, and decided to turn my primary workstation into a linux machine. 
### 3. But I still have a machine with Windows on it for the aforementioned reasons. 
### 4. So this directory in this repo is my attempt to define good practices for someone who might have Windows as their primary computer, and we can choose from it whatever we need.
### 5. Automating these steps would is the end goal.
### 6. But since this is not my preferred OS, I will not be putting too much of my time and energy into it.
